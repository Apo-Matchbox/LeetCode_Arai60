/*
Question 3:
Suppose John and Bill worked for some time and we want to calculate the total time both
of them worked. Write a program that reads number of days, hours, minutes each of them
worked, and prints the total time both of them worked together as days, hours, minutes.
Hint: Try to adapt the elementary method for addition of numbers to this use.
Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:
Please enter the number of days John has worked: 2
Please enter the number of hours John has worked: 12
Please enter the number of minutes John has worked: 15
Please enter the number of days Bill has worked: 3
Please enter the number of hours Bill has worked: 15
Please enter the number of minutes Bill has worked: 20
The total time both of them worked together is: 6 days, 3 hours and 35 minutes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int johnDays, johnHours, johnMinutes;
    int billDays, billHours, billMinutes;

    cout << "Please enter the number of days John has worked: ";
    cin >> johnDays;
    cout << "Please enter the number of hours John has worked: ";
    cin >> johnHours;
    cout << "Please enter the number of minutes John has worked: ";
    cin >> johnMinutes;

    cout << "Please enter the number of days Bill has worked: ";
    cin >> billDays;
    cout << "Please enter the number of hours Bill has worked: ";
    cin >> billHours;
    cout << "Please enter the number of minutes Bill has worked: ";
    cin >> billMinutes;

    int totalDays = johnDays + billDays;
    int totalHours = johnHours + billHours;
    int totalMinutes = johnMinutes + billMinutes;

    totalDays += totalHours / 24;
    totalHours %= 24;

    cout << "The total time both of them worked together is: " << totalDays << " days, " << totalHours << " hours, and " << totalMinutes << " minutes." << endl;

    return 0;
}

```
